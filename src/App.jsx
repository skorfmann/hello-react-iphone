          <p>
            This entire React application was created without touching a traditional computer. 
            Using WebSSH on my iPhone, I connected to my Mac Studio at home through Tailscale's 
            secure network. Then, with Claude Code as my AI assistant, I built, styled, and 
            deployed this app‚Äîall from my phone!
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a testament to how far mobile development has come. With the right tools, 
            you can code from anywhere, even from your pocket.
